    <p>Hi, I'm Benjamin Mallada, but you might find me also by my long, full name <a href="about\index.html">elsewhere</a>. I am a postdoctoral researcher in the field of Scanning Probe Microscopy in UHV at cryogenic conditions. I focus mainly on building and characterizing with atomic precision all sorts of molecular and atomic systems. I am particularly interested in the charge distribution in single molecules and atoms using Kelvin Probe Force Microscopy (KPFM), the on-surface synthesis of pi-conjugated systems, and the Electrospray Deposition (ESD) of big molecules or very fragile biomolecules. Currently, I am working at CATRIN-RCPTM in Palacky University Olomouc in the group of <a href="https://www.rcptm.com/groups/molecular-nanostructures-on-surfaces/">Molecular Nanostructures on Surfaces</a> and at <a href="https://nanosurf.fzu.cz/">NanosurfLab</a> in the Institute of Physics of the Czech Academy of Science in the Czech Republic.</p>
