			<p>Hi, I'm Benjamin Mallada, but you might find me also by my long, full name <a href="about\index.html">elsehwere</a> . I am a postdoctoral researcher in the field of Scanning Probe Microscopy in UHV at cryogenic conditions. I focus mainly in building and characterizing with atomic precision all sorts of molecular and atomic systems.I am particularly interested in the charge distribution in single molecules and atoms using Kelvin Probe Force Microscopy (KPFM), the on-surface synthesis of pi-conjugated systems and the Electrospray Deposition (ESD) of big molecules or very fragile biomolecules. Currently I am working at CATRIN-RCPTM in Palacky University Olomouc in the group of <a href="https://www.rcptm.com/groups/molecular-nanostructures-on-surfaces/">Molecular Nanostructures on Surfaces</a> and at <a href="https://nanosurf.fzu.cz/">NanosurfLab</a> in the Institute of Physics of the Czech Academy of Science in the Czech Republic using. </p>
