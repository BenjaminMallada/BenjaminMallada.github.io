    <p>I am a postdoctoral researcher in the field of Scanning Probe Microscopy under Ultra-High Vacuum (UHV) conditions at cryogenic temperatures. I am generally interested in building, manipulating, and characterizing molecular and atomic systems (check some of them <a href="/cv/">here</a>) and more particularly in the characterization of charge distribution in single molecules and atoms using Kelvin Probe Force Microscopy (KPFM), on-surface synthesis of pi-conjugated systems, and Electrospray Deposition (ESD) of large or fragile biomolecules. Currently, you can find me at CATRIN-RCPTM, Palacky University Olomouc, working with the group of <a href="https://www.rcptm.com/groups/molecular-nanostructures-on-surfaces/">Molecular Nanostructures on Surfaces</a>, and at <a href="https://nanosurf.fzu.cz/">NanosurfLab</a> at the Institute of Physics, Czech Academy of Sciences, in the Czech Republic.</p>
